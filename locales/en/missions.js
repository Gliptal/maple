The MiG-21, in all of its' variants, has fought in wars stretching all the way from the Vietnam War in the 1960's to the modern day Syrian Civil War. Owing to it's unique blend of versatility, ruggedness and maintainability, the MiG-21 remains in active service to this very day. Initially designed as a pure-bred interceptor, the MiG-21 has over the years evolved into a hybrid multi-role aircraft. In addition to a vast Air-to-Air arsenal, it can effectively employ unguided rockets, bombs and radar-guided missiles to destroy ground or naval targets.",

It is best known as the first swept wing fighter which could counter the similarly-winged Soviet MiG-15 in high-speed dogfights during the Korean War. Although it was developed in the late 1940s and was outdated by the end of the '50s, the Sabre proved versatile and adaptable, and continued as a front-line fighter in numerous air forces until 1994. Its success led to extended production runs of more than 7,800 aircraft between 1949 and 1956. The Canadair Sabre added another 1,815 airframes, and the significantly redesigned CAC Sabre (known as the Avon Sabre or CAC CA-27), had a production run of 112. The Sabre was by far the most-produced Western jet fighter, with total production of all variants at 9,860 units.",

The MiG-15 is believed to have been one of the most widely produced jet aircraft ever made - in excess of 12,000 were manufactured. Licensed foreign production may have raised the production total to over 18,000.
